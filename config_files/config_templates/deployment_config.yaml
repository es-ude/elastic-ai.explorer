# The DeploymentConfig gives the necessary information to connect to the target-device and deploy the model(s) on it.
# If parameters are not specified inside the config, they are set to default values.
DeploymentConfig:
  # Select one of the supported hardware platforms: "rpi4", "rpi5" or "pico". Optional. Defaults to "rpi5".
  target_platform_name: <platform_name>

  # This is used for RPi4/5. The target device must be reachable via established SSH-key. Optional.
  SSH:
    # The Hostname of target device. Optional. Defaults to "".
    target_name: "<host>"

    # The Username/user-account of the target device to connect to. Optional. Defaults to "".
    target_user: "<user>"

  # This is used for Pico. The target device must be reachable via serial connection. Optional.
  Serial:
    # The port on which serial connection is setup, necessary for Pico. Optional. Defaults to "/dev/ttyACM0".
    serial_port: <serial-port>

    # The path to which the Pico is mounted on the host system. Optional. Defaults to "".
    device_path: <device-path>

    # The baud rate for the serial connection. Optional. Defaults to 115200.
    baud_rate: <baud-rate>  

  Docker:
    # The path (on host) to additional pre-compiled libraries necessary for execution on target. If docker is used for deployment,
    # It needs to be in the docker build-context. Path must be relative to build-context.
    # Optional. Defaults to "./code/libtorch".
    compiled_library_path: "<path/to/library>"

    # Name of the Crosscompiler Image
    image_name: "cross"
