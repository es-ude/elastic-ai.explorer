##The config.yaml should have a ExperimentConfig that mainly changes the HW-Nas Behavior,
##a ConnectionConfig that gives the necessary information to connect to the target-device via ssh
##and a ModelConfig that defines the type of deep neural network you want to search for. If variables are not
##specified here, they are set to default values. Only ConnectionConfig has to be fully specified.

ExperimentConfig:
  ##Processor type (cpu, cuda:n) of the host, the experiment should run on.
  host_processor: "cuda:0" 

  ##The search trials the HW-NAS should do at max.
  max_search_trials: 2

  ##The number of top models returned by HW-NAS.
  top_n_models: 2

  ##Name of the experiment in nni, also defines where the experiment outputs are saved.
  ##Careful, if keeping the same name, results are overwriten.
  #experiment_name: "test"

ConnectionConfig:
  ##The Hostname of target device.
  target_name: "transfair.local"

  ##The Username/user-account of the target device to connect to.
  target_user: "robin"

ModelConfig:
  ##Model type/architecture to search for.
  model_type: "MLP"
